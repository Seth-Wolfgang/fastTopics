to do
=====

+ Update pkgdown site.

+ Update volcano plots.

+ Add/revise tests for volcano plot functions.

+ Update poisson_demo.R and multinom_demo.R.

+ Implement KKT-based stopping criterion for fit_poisson_nmf.

+ Prune functions in misc.R, misc.h and misc.cpp that are no longer
  used.

+ Refactor pca_plot, pca_hexbin_plot and tsne_plot code, and redesign
  the interface for plotting embeddings from the L matrix. Also,
  consider implementing umap_plot and umap_from_topics, and allow for
  using UMAP instead of t-SNE in the Structure plot.

+ Clean up files that are no longer needed or out of date.

+ Implement "t" S3 method to transpose the rows and columns of a
  Poisson NMF fit.

+ Implement integrations for Seurat, Signac and/or ArchR.

+ Implement backtracking line search option for SCD algorithm.

+ Create vignette giving more details about the differential
  expression analysis.

+ Create vignette giving more details about the different optimization
  algorithms. (Then simplify the fit_poisson_nmf example.)

+ Create vignette illustrating application of fastTopics to text data,
  with a focus on the different ways to visualize the results.
