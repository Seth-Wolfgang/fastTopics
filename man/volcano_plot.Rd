\arguments{
\item{diff_count_result}{An object of class
\dQuote{topic_model_diff_count}, usually an output from
\code{\link{diff_count_analysis}}.}

\item{k}{The topic, or topics, selected by number or name. When not
specified, all topics are plotted.}

\item{labels}{Character vector specifying how the points in the
volcano plot are labeled. This should be a character vector with
one entry per LFC estimate (row of
\code{diff_count_result$beta}). When not specified, the row names
of \code{diff_count_result$beta} are used, if available. Labels are
added to the plot using \code{\link[ggrepel]{geom_text_repel}}.}

\item{y}{The measure of support to plot in the y-axis: use \code{y
= "zscore"} to plot the z-score magnitudes; use \code{y = "pvalue"}
to plot the -log1 p-values.}

\item{betamax}{Truncate the LFC statistics (\code{beta}) by this
amount. Any statistics greater than than \code{betamax} are set to
\code{betamax}, and any statistics less than \code{-betamax} are
set to \code{-betamax}.}

\item{label_above_lfc}{Only z-scores or p-values (depending on
choice of \code{y}) with LFC estimates above this value are
labeled in the volcano plot.}

\item{label_above_quantile}{Only z-scores or p-values (depending on
choice of \code{y}) above this quantile are labeled in the volcano
plot.}

\item{subsample_below_quantile}{A number between 0 and 1. If
greater than zero, LFC estimates with z-scores or p-values below
this quantile will be subsampled according to
\code{subsample_rate}. This can be helpful to reduce the number of
points plotted for a large data set.}

\item{subsample_rate}{A number between 0 and 1 giving the
proportion of LFC estimates with small z-scores that are included
in the plot, uniformly at random. This is only used if
\code{subsample_below_quantile} is greater than zero.}

\item{max.overlaps}{Argument passed to
\code{\link[ggrepel]{geom_text_repel}}.}

\item{ggplot_call}{The function used to create the plot. Replace
\code{volcano_plot_ggplot_call} with your own function to customize
the appearance of the plot.}

\item{plot_grid_call}{When multiple topics are selected, this is
the function used to arrange the plots into a grid using
\code{\link[cowplot]{plot_grid}}. It should be a function accepting
a single argument, \code{plots}, a list of \code{ggplot} objects.}

\item{x}{An object of class \dQuote{topic_model_diff_count},
usually an output from \code{\link{diff_count_analysis}}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to \code{volcano_plot}.}

\item{file}{Save the interactive volcano plot to this HTML
file using \code{\link[htmlwidgets]{saveWidget}}.}

\item{width}{Width of the plot in pixels. Passed as argument
\dQuote{width} to \code{\link[plotly]{plot_ly}}.}

\item{height}{Height of the plot in pixels. Passed as argument
\dQuote{height} to \code{\link[plotly]{plot_ly}}.}

\item{title}{The text used for the plot title.}

\item{plot_ly_call}{The function used to create the plot. Replace
\code{volcano_plot_ly_call} with your own function to customize
the appearance of the interactive plot.}

\item{dat}{A data frame passed as input to
\code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}, containing, at a minimum, columns
\dQuote{label}, \dQuote{mean}, \dQuote{beta}, \dQuote{se},
\dQuote{z}, \dQuote{pval} and \dQuote{label}.}

\item{y.label}{Label to use in the plot for \dQuote{dat$y}.}

\item{topic.label}{The name or number of the topic being plotted.
Only used to determine the plot title.}

\item{font.size}{Font size used in plot.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object or a \code{plotly} object.
}
\description{
Create one or more "volcano" plots to visualize the
  results of a differential count analysis using a topic model. A
  volcano plot is a scatterplot in which the log-fold change (LFC),
  estimated using a multinomial topic model, is plotted against the
  p-value or z-score.
}
\details{
The colour of the points is varied by the average count,
on the logarithmic scale; since the evidence (z-score or p-value)
typically increases with more observed counts, the variables with
smallest average counts should usually appear toward the bottom of
the volcano plot. Only points above a specified z-score (or
p-value) quantile are labeled. Note that points with an average
count of zero or less are not shown.

To better accommodate situations in which some z-scores (or
p-values) are much larger than all the others, the z-scores and
-log10 p-values are plotted on the square-root scale. To change
this, as well as other aspects, of the plot, replace
\code{volcano_plot_ggplot_call} with your own function; see input
argument \dQuote{ggplot_call}.

The \dQuote{ggrepel} package is used to arrange the labels in a
visually attractive manner.

Use interactive volcano plot is created using the \dQuote{plotly}
package. The \dQuote{hover text} shows the label (see input argument
\dQuote{labels}) and detailed LFC statistics as they were
calculated by \code{\link{diff_count_analysis}}.
